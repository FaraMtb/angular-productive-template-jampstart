# Angular Productive JumpStart with TypeScript

The goal of this jumpstart app is to provide
a simple way to get started with Angular 2+ while also showing several key Angular features. The sample
relies on the Angular CLI to build the application.



## Angular Concepts Covered

* TypeScript version that relies on classes and modules
* Modules are loaded with System.js
* Defining routes including child routes and lazy loaded routes
* Using Custom Components including custom input and output properties
* Using Custom Directives
* Using Custom Pipes
* Defining Properties and Using Events in Components/Directives
* Using the Http object for Ajax calls along with RxJS observables
* Working with Utility and Service classes (such as for sorting and Ajax calls)
* Using Angular databinding Syntax [], () and [()]
* Using template-driven and reactive forms functionality for capturing and validating data
* Optional: Webpack functionality is available for module loading and more (see below for details)
* Optional: Ahead-of-Time (AOT) functionality is available for a production build of the project (see below for details)

## Running the Application 


1. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies

1. Run `ng build --watch` to build and bundle the code

1. Run `npm start` in a separate terminal window to build the TypeScript, watch for changes and launch the web server

1. Go to http://localhost:4200 in your browser 

Simply clone the project or download and extract the .zip to get started. 

Once the app is running you can play around with editing customers after you login. Use any email address and any password that's at least 6 characters long (with 1 digit).
